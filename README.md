## Subsetting Functions Overview

``` r
source("lmForc_subset.R")
```

The Forecast class has a built in method for subsetting a single
Forecast object. This subsetting method takes numeric or logical values
and follows subsetting conventions that are present throughout the R
language.

``` r
forc1_1h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-05", "2011-03-10")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(4.27, 3.36, 4.78, 5.45, 5.12),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26, 4.99, 5.38),
  h_ahead = 1
)

forc1_1h[2:4]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 2 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 3 2010-12-05 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99

forc1_1h[origin(forc1_1h) >= as.Date("2010-12-31")]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2011-03-10 2011-06-30     5.12     5.38
```

However, one often ends up working with multiple Forecast objects
whether that be different model forecasts for the same forecast horizon,
one model forecast for varying forecast horizons, or both. The lmForc
convention for working with multiple Forecast objects is to put them
into a list. The following subsetting functions provide a way to subset
multiple Forecast objects by various conditions.

### Subsetting Example Dataset

Examples of lmForc subsetting functions utilize the following stylized
dataset. This example dataset contains two forecasts with one quarter
ahead forecasts of the same variable. Note that both forecasts have
identical `future`, `realized`, and `h_ahead` values, but that `origin`
dates of the last two forecasts differ. These example forecasts can be
thought of as two different model forecasts of the same variable.

``` r
forc1_1h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-05", "2011-03-10")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(4.27, 3.36, 4.78, 5.45, 5.12),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26, 4.99, 5.38),
  h_ahead = 1
)

forc2_1h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22", "2011-03-27")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(4.01, 3.89, 3.31, 4.33, 4.61),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26, 4.99, 5.38),
  h_ahead = 1
)
```

## subset_forcs

The simplest way to subset multiple Forecast objects is via the
`subset_forcs()` function. The function takes a list of Forecast objects
and a numeric or logical index. All forecasts in the list are subset by
the whatever is passed to the `index` argument.

``` r
forcs <- list(forc1_1h, forc2_1h)

subset_forcs(forcs, 2:3)
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 2 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.89     4.17
#> 2 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     3.31     4.26
 
subset_forcs(forcs, origin(forc1_1h) >= as.Date("2010-12-31"))
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2011-03-10 2011-06-30     5.12     5.38
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2011-03-27 2011-06-30     4.61     5.38
```

## subset_bytime

One may wish to compare forecasts over a specific time horizon. The
`subset_bytime()` allows the user to subset multiple forecasts based on
`origin` or `future` values. After choosing whether to subset by
`origin` or `future` values and passing a single time object or a vector
of time objects to the `values` argument, all forecasts in a list of
Forecast objects are subset by `values`.

``` r
forcs <- list(forc1_1h, forc2_1h)
 
subset_bytime(forcs, values = as.Date("2010-05-14"), slot = "origin")
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.89     4.17

subset_bytime(
  forcs, 
  values = as.Date(c("2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31")), 
  slot = "future"
)
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 2 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 3 2010-12-05 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.89     4.17
#> 2 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     3.31     4.26
#> 3 2010-12-22 2011-03-31     4.33     4.99
```

## subset_identical

When comparing multiple forecasts, it is imperative that forecast
accuracy is compared across an identical time period. This can become
complicated if the `origin` and `future` values of multiple forecasts do
not always align. The `subset_identical()` function finds all
overlapping `origin` or `future` values in a list of Forecast objects
and subsets each of the forecasts to these overlapping values. This
leaves the user with a list of Forecasts that have either identical
`origin` values or identical `future` values depending on what the user
passes to the `slot` argument.

``` r
forcs <- list(forc1_1h, forc2_1h)

subset_identical(forcs, slot = "origin")
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-06-30     4.27     4.96
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 3 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-06-30     4.01     4.96
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.89     4.17
#> 3 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     3.31     4.26
```

## Transformation Functions Overview

``` r
source("lmForc_transform.R")
```

Forecasts are often produced for multiple `h_ahead` horizons into the
future. For example, a model may produce a 1-quarter ahead, 2-quarter
ahead, 3-quarter ahead, and 4-quarter ahead forecast during each quarter
of the year. In this example, a different Forecast object is needed to
capture the forecasts made during each quarter. As per lmForc
convention, one would work with these forecasts by putting them into a
list.

When working with forecasts for multiple `h_ahead` horizons into the
future, there are two general formats in which the forecasts can be
organized. These two formats are: **Time Format** and **h_ahead
Format**.

### Time Format

**Time Format** consists of a list of Forecast objects where each
forecast has homogenous `origin` or `future` values. Each Forecast
object in the list was made at the same time or contains forecasts for
the same future time. However, the `h_ahead` forecast horizon differs
within each Forecast object. **Time Format** is used to represent the
case when a forecast with multiple `h_ahead` horizons is made at
multiple `origin` times.

The following is an example of forecasts in **Time Format**. Each
Forecast object represents a set of 1-quarter, 2-quarter, and 3-quarter
ahead forecasts made during each quarter of 2010. Note that because each
Forecast object contains forecasts for multiple `h_ahead` horizons,
`h_ahead` is set to `NA`.

``` r
forc1_t1 <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-02-17", "2010-02-17")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31")),
  forecast = c(4.27, 3.77, 3.52),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26),
  h_ahead = NA
)

forc1_t2 <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-05-14", "2010-05-14", "2010-05-14")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31")),
  forecast = c(3.36, 3.82, 4.22),
  realized = c(4.17, 4.26, 4.99),
  h_ahead = NA
)

forc1_t3 <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-07-22", "2010-07-22", "2010-07-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(4.78, 4.53, 5.03),
  realized = c(4.26, 4.99, 5.33),
  h_ahead = NA
)

forc1_t4 <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-12-22", "2010-12-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2011-03-31", "2011-06-30", "2011-09-30")),
  forecast = c(5.45, 4.89, 5.78),
  realized = c(4.99, 5.33, 5.21),
  h_ahead = NA
)

forcs_time_format <- list(forc1_t1, forc1_t2, forc1_t3, forc1_t4)
```

### h_ahead Format

**h_ahead Format** consists of a list of Forecast objects where each
forecast has homogenous `h_ahead` values but the `origin` and `future`
values vary. The **h_ahead Format** is useful for analyzing forecasts at
a specific `h_ahead` horizon. For example, one may want to calculate the
forecast accuracy of 4-quarter ahead forecasts only. In this case it is
useful to have multiple forecasts arranged by homogenous `h_ahead`
values.

The following is an example of forecasts in **h_ahead Format**. Each
Forecast object represents all of the 1-quarter, 2-quarter, and
3-quarter ahead forecasts made during different quarters of 2010. Note
that because each Forecast object has a homogenous `h_ahead` horizon we
can now set `h_ahead` to the appropriate value.

``` r
forc1_1h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31")),
  forecast = c(4.27, 3.36, 4.78, 5.45),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26, 4.99),
  h_ahead = 1
)

forc1_2h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(3.77, 3.82, 4.53, 4.89),
  realized = c(4.17, 4.26, 4.99, 5.33),
  h_ahead = 2
)

forc1_3h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30", "2011-09-30")),
  forecast = c(3.52, 4.22, 5.03, 5.78),
  realized = c(4.26, 4.99, 5.33, 5.21),
  h_ahead = 3
)

forcs_h_ahead_format <- list(forc1_1h, forc1_2h, forc1_3h)
```

## convert_bytime

Given a list of forecasts in **h_ahead Format** one may wish to convert
one or multiple of these forecasts into **Time Format**. The function
`convert_bytime()` take a list of Forecast objects in **h_ahead Format**
and converts the forecasts made on the time specified by the `value` and
`slot` arguments into Forecast objects in **Time Format**. Note that
because we are converting to **Time Format**, the `h_ahead` value in
each Forecast object is changed to `NA`.

``` r
convert_bytime(
  forcs_h_ahead_format,
  value = as.Date(c("2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  slot = "origin"
)
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 2 2010-07-22 2011-03-31     4.53     4.99
#> 3 2010-07-22 2011-06-30     5.03     5.33
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-12-22 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99
#> 2 2010-12-22 2011-06-30     4.89     5.33
#> 3 2010-12-22 2011-09-30     5.78     5.21
```

## transform_bytime

Given a list of forecasts in **h_ahead Format** one can convert all of
the forecasts to **Time Format** using the `transform_bytime()`
function. This function transforms all Forecast objects in `forcs` to a
list of **Time Format** Forecast objects that have homogenous `origin`
or `future` values depending on what the user specifies in the `slot`
argument. The difference between `transform_bytime()` and
`convert_bytime()` is that transforming automatically converts all
forecasts in the list while converting only converts the forecasts
specified by the user.

``` r
transform_bytime(forcs_h_ahead_format, slot = "origin")
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-06-30     4.27     4.96
#> 2 2010-02-17 2010-09-30     3.77     4.17
#> 3 2010-02-17 2010-12-31     3.52     4.26
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-12-31     3.82     4.26
#> 3 2010-05-14 2011-03-31     4.22     4.99
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 2 2010-07-22 2011-03-31     4.53     4.99
#> 3 2010-07-22 2011-06-30     5.03     5.33
#> 
#> [[4]]
#> h_ahead = NA 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-12-22 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99
#> 2 2010-12-22 2011-06-30     4.89     5.33
#> 3 2010-12-22 2011-09-30     5.78     5.21
```

Note that the output of `transform_bytime()` above is identical to the
list of Forecast objects in `forcs_time_format`. One can continually
transform between **Time Format** and **h_ahead Format**. This is
evidenced by the fact that:
`transform_bytime(forcs_h_ahead_format, slot = "origin") == forcs_time_format`
and
`transform_byh(forcs_time_format, h_aheads = c(1, 2, 3)) == forcs_h_ahead_format`.

## convert_byh

The inverse of `convert_bytime()` is `convert_byh()`. Given a list of
forecasts in **Time Format** `convert_byh()` converts one or multiple of
these forecasts into **h_ahead Format**. The functions takes a list of
Forecast objects in **Time Format** and converts the forecasts specified
by the `index` argument into Forecast objects in **h_ahead Format**.
Because forecasts that are in **Time Format** do not have `h_ahead`
values, the function allows the user to assign `h_ahead` values to the
converted Forecast objects via the `h_aheads` argument.

``` r
convert_byh(forcs_time_format, index = 1L, h_aheads = 1)
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-06-30     4.27     4.96
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 3 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 4 2010-12-22 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99
 
convert_byh(forcs_time_format, index = 1:2, h_aheads = c(1, 2))
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-06-30     4.27     4.96
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-09-30     3.36     4.17
#> 3 2010-07-22 2010-12-31     4.78     4.26
#> 4 2010-12-22 2011-03-31     5.45     4.99
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> h_ahead = 2 
#> 
#>       origin     future forecast realized
#> 1 2010-02-17 2010-09-30     3.77     4.17
#> 2 2010-05-14 2010-12-31     3.82     4.26
#> 3 2010-07-22 2011-03-31     4.53     4.99
#> 4 2010-12-22 2011-06-30     4.89     5.33
```

## transform_byh

Given a list of forecasts in **Time Format** one can convert all of the
forecasts to **h_ahead Format** using the `transform_byh()` function.
This function transforms all Forecast objects in `forcs` to a list of
**h_ahead Format** Forecast objects that have homogenous `h_ahead`
values. `h_ahead` values are assigned to each converted Forecast object
based on the values passed by the user to the `h_aheads` argument. The
difference between `transform_byh()` and `convert_byh()` is that
transforming automatically converts all forecasts in the list while
converting only converts the forecasts specified by the user.

``` r
transform_byh(forcs_time_format, h_aheads = c(1, 2, 3))
#> [[1]]
#> h_ahead = 1 
#>

Note that the output of `transform_byh()` above is identical to the list
of Forecast objects in `forcs_h_ahead_format`. One can continually
transform between **Time Format** and **h_ahead Format**. This is
evidenced by the fact that:
`transform_byh(forcs_time_format, h_aheads = c(1, 2, 3)) == forcs_h_ahead_format`
and
`transform_bytime(forcs_h_ahead_format, slot = "origin") == forcs_time_format`.

## Visualization Functions Overview

``` r
source("lmForc_visualize.R")
```

When comparing various forecast models, two common strategies are to
compare forecast accuracy and look at plots of forecasted and realized
values. However, when comparing multiple forecast models across multiple
`h_ahead` forecast horizons, the number of Forecast objects that one has
to consider can quickly get out of hand and analyzing forecasts can
become tedious. The following functions are designed to simplify the
process comparing forecast models.

## accuracy_table

If one is analyzing one forecast model at various `h_ahead` forecast
horizons, these forecasts can be contained in a list of Forecast objects
that is in **h_ahead Format**. If the number of forecast models being
analyzed increases to more than one model, than the process above may be
repeated and all **h_ahead Format** lists may be combined into a list of
lists. The index of the outer list refers to the various Forecast models
and the index of the inner list refers to the `h_ahead` forecast made by
each model. The `accuracy_table()` function takes this list of list and
converts it into a data.frame showing forecast accuracy across various
forecast models and `h_ahead` forecast horizons. The output data.frame
contains one column for each forecast model and one row for each of the
forecast horizons that the user passes to the `horizon` argument. Note
that the order of the Forecast objects in each list matters. If one of
the integers in the horizon argument is 4, then the function will
compute the forecast accuracy of each Forecast object at index 4 of the
inner list and output these values as one row in the output data.frame.
If the Forecast objects in the inner list are unordered or of
incomparable length, the output data.frame will not contain fair
accuracy comparisons. Forecast accuracy is computed based on the
forecast accuracy function that the users passes to the `metric`
argument.

Another forecast model `forc2` that consists of an **h_ahead Format**
forecast list is added below to demonstrate how `accuracy_table()` is
used to calculate forecast accuracy across multiple forecast models and
`h_ahead` forecast horizons.

``` r
forc2_1h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31")),
  forecast = c(3.22, 3.25, 3.01, 3.76),
  realized = c(4.96, 4.17, 4.26, 4.99),
  h_ahead = 1
)

forc2_2h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-09-30", "2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30")),
  forecast = c(3.53, 3.88, 4.01, 4.05),
  realized = c(4.17, 4.26, 4.99, 5.33),
  h_ahead = 2
)

forc2_3h <- Forecast(
  origin = as.Date(c("2010-02-17", "2010-05-14", "2010-07-22", "2010-12-22")),
  future = as.Date(c("2010-12-31", "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30", "2011-09-30")),
  forecast = c(3.89, 4.04, 4.21, 4.40),
  realized = c(4.26, 4.99, 5.33, 5.21),
  h_ahead = 3
)

forcs2_h_ahead_format <- list(forc2_1h, forc2_2h, forc2_3h)

accuracy_table(
  forcs = list(forcs_h_ahead_format, forcs2_h_ahead_format),
  horizon = c(1, 2, 3),
  metric = "rmse",
  colnames = c("forc1", "forc2"),
  rownames = c("1h", "2h", "3h")
)
#>        forc1     forc2
#> 1h 0.6352559 1.3180857
#> 2h 0.4355456 0.8878063
#> 3h 0.6235784 0.8587636
```

## plot_forc

The `plot_forc` functions allows on or multiple Forecast objects to be
easily plotted. This functions takes a single Forecast object or a list
of Forecast objects and returns a ggplot with forecasted and realized
values on the y-axis and `future` values on the x-axis. The ggplot call
is returned to the console and the data.frame used to render the ggplot
may be optionally returned with the `return_df` argument. These features
allow the user to manually edit the plot afterwards if necessary.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

plot_forc(
  forcs = list(forc1_1h, forc2_1h),
  labels = c("forc1 1h forecast", "forc2 1h forecast"),
  colors = c("blue", "red"),
  xlab = "Realized Date",
  ylab = "Forecasted Value",
  title = "1h Ahead Forecast Comparison"
)
#> ggplot(data = df, aes(x = future)) + 
#>     geom_line(aes(y = realized, colour = 'Realized Values'), lwd = 0.6) + 
#>     geom_line(aes(y = forc1, colour = 'forc1 1h forecast'), lwd = 0.6) + 
#>     geom_line(aes(y = forc2, colour = 'forc2 1h forecast'), lwd = 0.6) + 
#>  scale_color_manual(
#>     breaks = c('Realized Values', 'forc1 1h forecast', 'forc2 1h forecast'), 
#>     values = c('black', 'blue', 'red')
#>   ) + 
#>   labs(title = '1h Ahead Forecast Comparison', 
#>     x = 'Realized Date', 
#>     y = 'Forecasted Value', 
#>     caption = '',
#>     colour = NULL
#>   ) + 
#>   theme_light() + 
#>   theme(legend.position = c('0.1', '0.9'))
```
